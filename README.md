# SelfAvoidingWalk

I got this idea from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6-cm6GZ1iw&t=1944s

I recently found YouTube video that shows a self-avoiding walk as a brute force algorithm on a grid. The walker starts at one cell on the grid, picks a random direction, and moves one cell in that direction. Essentially, the walker avoids itself and can backtrack if there are no other possibilities for movement and the walker has not successfully visited all the cells in the grid. At the end of the video, the creator challenges the watcher to recreate his program, but in three dimensions rather than the two he programmed it in. I was inspired by this challenge and am proud of the outcome. I think it’s one of the most polished programs I’ve created.
