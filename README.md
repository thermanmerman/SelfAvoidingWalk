# SelfAvoidingWalk

I got this idea from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6-cm6GZ1iw&t=1944s

I love watching these kinds of videos in my free time, and I found this one particularly interesting. In case you don't watch it in its entirety (although I do recommend it), a self avoiding walk is a brute force algorithm that is on a grid. The walker starts at one cell on the grid, picks a random direction, and moves one cell in that direction. The walker avoids itself and can back track if there are no other possibilities for movement and the walker has not successfully visited all the cells in the grid. The video explains it a lot better than I can, but that's the gyst. At the end of the video, the creator challenges the watcher to make the same thing, but in three dimensions rather than the two that he made it in. I was inspired by this challenge and decided to try it. This is likely my most polished projects in memory and one of my most recent.
